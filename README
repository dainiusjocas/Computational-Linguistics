Aim of this project is to extract collocations from Brown text corpus.

Steps to do this:
IDEA: maybe it would be better to build collocations structure while reading from xml file?
1. Read  xml document s tags
2. For each pair of <w> tags do the test if it can be a collocation.
  2.1. use hash for storing the data.

ToDo:
!. what i'm suppose to do with dots? HOW? (solved)
1 (possible). build a hash from NN_NN, JJ_NN, VB_NN pairs. the key is the first
  word in a collocation (head) second is array of tails.
2+. split line into words.
3+. split word into
4+. iterate through the corpus.
5. count the matches in collocation units.

Real steps done:
1. opens xml document
2. navigates xml document for sentences.
2.1 sentence is the word list with type only NN, VB, JJ
3. when parser reaches the end of the sentence the sentence is sent to bigrams
  hash.
4. Builds hash of startings of collocations with counter.
5. Builds hash of endings of collocations with counter.

Fixes:
1. Fixed 'one bigram in a file' problem. This problem appears when file hasn't
  dot at the end of the sentence.
2. Hash.sort method change the type to an array
