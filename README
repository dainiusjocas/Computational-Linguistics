Aim of this project is to extract collocations from Brown text corpus.

Steps to do this:
IDEA: maybe it would be better to build collocations structure while reading from xml file?
1. Read  xml document s tags
2. For each pair of <w> tags do the test if it can be a collocation.
  2.1. use hash for storing the data.

ToDo:
!. what i'm suppose to do with dots? HOW?
1 (possible). build a hash from NN_NN, JJ_NN, VB_NN pairs. the key is the first
  word in a collocation (head) second is array of tails.
2+. split line into words.
3+. split word into
4+. iterate through the corpus.
5. count the matches in collocation units.

Real steps done:
1. opens xml document
2. navigates xml document for words.
3. Constructs array of sentences where sentence contains words in format
[word/type].
