TOPIC: "Collocation Extraction"
PAPER:
Dekang Lin, "Extracting Collocations from Text Corpora".
PROJECT:
Investigate various methods of extracting collocations from a corpus and finding
  relations between them.
Steps:
1. Download the Brown Corpus http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nltk_data/index.xml
2. Search for continuous collocations of length 2 (bigrams), and accept only
  collocations that match one of the following patterns: NN_NN, JJ_NN, VB_NN.
Find collocations using different methods:
2a. Simple frequency counting: For each collocation, keep track of its count and
  the location within the corpus of all occurrence. Sort the collocations by
  frequency count, and take the top 1000.
2b. Same fashion as in the simple frequency count, but at the end compute the 
  chi-squares values of the collocations, and order the collocations by
  decreasing chi-square value.
3. Look for similar collocations:
3a. Take the list of the top N collocations found counting simple frequency (2a)
   and try to measure the correlation between two of them and the rest.
3b.For each collocation, take 200 words of the context around each occurrence 
  and obtain counts of the words occurring in the context window of that
  collocation.
3c. Measure similarities between these distributions and the target collocation 
  using one of the following metrics: Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance,
  Cosine, or Information Radius.
3d. Report the top 10 "closest" collocations for each target word.

I wrote you the steps you have to carry out in order to accomplish your project.
  I hope the procedure is clear.

Please, tell me if you think it is fine with you.

Thanks.

Best,
Elena
